# Critical temperature of Superconductors

**Superconductors** - materials that conduct electrical current and magnetic field with zero resistance and low energy losses

**Applications**
    - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
    - Ultra-efficient electricity grids
    - Ultra-fast and energy efficient computer chips
    - Ultra-powerful magnets that can be used to levitate trains and control fusion reactors


**Issue** - Superconductivity of materials is reached when the materials are at or below its superconductivity critical temperature - There is no theory-based model of finding the critical temperature specific to each material

**Solution** - Data-based prediction of superconductors critical temperature using their structural data 

Work based on the paper [A data-driven statistical model for predicting the critical temperature of a superconductor](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2018.07.052) by Kam Hamidieh

The dataset used is put together by Kam Hamidieh and it is available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://doi.org/10.24432/C53P47)
